## TODO

- Some really big files.

- Performance analysis

- Fix massive amounts of technical debt

- Test cases where the loader should fail. E.g. rdfs that don't match schema,
  or indexes against incorrect schema type.

- Facets (don't know how these work)
- XID edges (don't know how these work)
