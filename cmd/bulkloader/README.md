## TODO

- Some really big files, e.g. golden data -- suspect this will break lease. (ok
  to continue on to initial performance analysis with broken lease).

- Or maybe better to artificially create a test to break the lease. I could
  easily generate a test data rdf file on the fly.

- Performance analysis

- Fix massive amounts of technical debt

- Test cases where the loader should fail

- Facets (don't even know how these work)
- XID edges (don't even know how these work)
